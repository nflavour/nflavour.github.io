+Preface:+

For a while now, I've been wondering how can I host a web application with the freedom to customize my system however I want (like when I develop on my Mac). Shared host are definitely not working. They do provide many of the popular apps like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. But they lack the ability to switch versions or add add-ons and plug-ins. So shared hosting ends up being very limited.

I've been researching for a while on something relative simple and cheap for me to host my apps and what not. Very quickly, I learned about Amazon Web Services (AWS). But it was very intimidating, with so many services and products that I have no idea what they do. I thought I was looking for a service/product that can be managed similarly to a shared host, but with more power in managing the installed applications. Researching more, I learned about a few more cloud hosts, where I learned about Saas (something I've heard many times before), Paas, and Iaas. Though, I'm still very confused, I think I have a better understanding of the kind of services I'm looking for.

#### Saas ####

Saas stands for "Software as a Service"
