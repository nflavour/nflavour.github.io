### Blog about everything I learn ###

This is the place where I can go and post random ideas, notes, code, etc. It could be for the public or a reminder for myself in case I need to do this again in the future. And, I've heard this numerous times, writing stuff down helps with remembering them.

### This blog uses Jekyll ###

Jekyll is definitely a really cool piece of software. Being able to make a blog without a database is pretty amazing. Also I love writing in markdown. Just something about it make it, free, fun, elegant.

Practicing with the layouts and liquid templates really helps with front end design. Do more of it.

**TODO:**

* Be more active, add more content
* Play with the layout and templates
* Learn sass (for general purpose too)
